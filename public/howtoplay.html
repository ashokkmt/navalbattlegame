<p><strong>Naval Battle Online</strong> is a <strong>war-themed</strong> board game for <strong>two players</strong> in which <strong>the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them.</strong> A paper and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most people are familiar with the game through the plastic board game that was first marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967. Since then, the game has spawned various video games and smartphone app variations. <br />You are on a <strong>digital version</strong> of the same <strong>game</strong>, designed by <strong>Akshay Godara</strong>.</p>
<p>The gameplay is straightforward. <br />Each player places ships on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. <br />Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Players take turns firing&nbsp;shots (by calling out a grid coordinate) to attempt to hit the opponent's enemy ships.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-20" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On your turn, simply click on your target grid. computer will automatically check that coordinate on opponent's ocean grid and the hit will <span style="color: #008000;">remain white</span>, if there is no ship there, or will <span style="color: #ff0000;">turn red</span> if you have correctly guessed a space that is occupied by a ship.</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-23" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block">&nbsp;</div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-24" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it is your opponent's turn to fire shots at you, each time one of your ships receives a hit, the computer will put a red signal into the hole on. When one of your ships has every slot filled with red, the computer will automatically announce that your ship has been killed. In classic play, the phrase is "You sunk my battleship!"</p>
<p>The first player to sink all five of their opponent's ships wins the game.<br /><br /></p>
