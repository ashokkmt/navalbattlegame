# naval-battle game
javaScript HTML and CSS 

In this game , I successfully made the famous retro game battleships .



In this walkthrough we will:
- make 5 draggable ships
- rotate the ships prior to dragging
- make the computer take random hits
- display results based on who has sunk whos ship
- display the winner

This is in pure javascript.

We will not be focusing too much on the styling, if anything matters the most , then it is the logic of the game.
